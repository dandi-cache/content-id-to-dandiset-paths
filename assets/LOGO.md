# DANDI Cache Logo

This document describes the newly created DANDI Cache logo.

## Logo File

The logo is located at: `assets/logo.svg`

## Design Concept

The DANDI Cache logo is a derivative of the main DANDI Archive logo, designed to represent the entire DANDI Cache subproject (not just this specific repository).

### Original Elements from DANDI Archive

- **Brain Icon**: Pink/coral colored brain representing neuroscience data (colors: #D3868D, #F0A5AC, #A05A60)
- **Beaker Icon**: Laboratory flask representing scientific research
- **DANDI Text**: Bold dark blue text (#00436D) preserving brand identity

### New Cache-Specific Elements

- **Network Nodes**: Four circular nodes in teal/blue (#4A90A4) representing cache infrastructure points
- **Connection Lines**: Lines connecting the nodes representing data paths and relationships between cached content
- **CACHE Text**: Teal/blue subtitle text clearly identifying this as the Cache variant

## Visual Metaphor

The network overlay creates a visual metaphor for:
- **Caching Infrastructure**: The nodes represent distributed cache points
- **Content Mapping**: The connecting lines represent the relationships and paths tracked by the cache
- **Data Flow**: The network structure suggests efficient data routing and retrieval

## Color Palette

| Element | Color | Hex Code |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Brain (main) | Light coral | #F0A5AC |
| Brain (accent) | Medium coral | #D3868D |
| Brain (detail) | Dark coral | #A05A60 |
| Beaker/Text | Dark blue | #00436D |
| Cache nodes/text | Teal blue | #4A90A4 |
| Background | White | #FFFFFF |

## Technical Specifications

- **Format**: SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)

## Usage

The logo is displayed at the top of the README:

```markdown
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/logo.svg" alt="DANDI Cache Logo" width="600"/>
</div>
```

## Design Rationale

1. **Brand Consistency**: Maintains strong visual connection to DANDI Archive
2. **Clear Differentiation**: Cache-specific elements clearly identify this as a subproject
3. **Scalability**: SVG format ensures the logo looks sharp at any size
4. **Professional**: Extends the scientific, professional aesthetic of the main brand
5. **Meaningful**: The network overlay provides visual meaning beyond decoration

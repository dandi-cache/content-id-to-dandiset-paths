## Design Concept

The DANDI Cache logo is a cache-focused design that prominently features database storage containers with the DANDI brain integrated as a branded element. The design immediately conveys caching functionality while maintaining connection to the DANDI ecosystem. The logo is text-free for universal recognition.

### Core Elements

**Cache Database Stack** (Main Focus - Center)
- Three stacked cylindrical database containers
- Dark blue bodies (#00436D) with teal caps (#4A90A4)
- Represents multi-layered cache storage infrastructure
- Horizontal lines showing data layer separation
- Industry-standard database cylinder icon
- The largest and most prominent element

**DANDI Brain** (Integrated Brand Element)
- Small brain icon embedded in the top cylinder
- Pink/coral colors (#F0A5AC, #D3868D, #A05A60)
- Scaled to 13% - subtle but recognizable
- Represents that this is DANDI-branded cache
- Indicates neuroscience data being cached

**Large Hash Symbols** (Left & Right)
- Two prominent hash (#) symbols flanking the database stack
- Cyan color (#6BB6CC)
- Represent key-value pairs and content addressing
- Large size emphasizes cache lookup mechanism
- Core concept of hash-based caching

**Network Nodes** (4 Corners)
- Concentric circles at all four corners
- Light blue outer (#A8D5E2), teal middle (#4A90A4), dark blue center (#00436D)
- Connected to cache stack with lines
- Represent distributed cache access points
- Show network topology

**Data Flow Arrows** (Corner nodes)
- Directional arrows pointing toward cache
- Cyan color (#6BB6CC) with transparency
- Indicate active data transfer into cache
- Show read/write operations

**Cache Entry Indicators** (On cylinders)
- Small rectangles on left and right sides of each cylinder
- Light blue (#A8D5E2) with transparency
- Represent individual cached data entries
- Show storage granularity

## Visual Metaphor

The logo creates a clear cache-focused representation:
- **Cache Storage**: Stacked cylinders are the dominant visual element
- **Multi-Layer**: Three tiers represent cache hierarchy (L1, L2, L3 or hot/warm/cold)
- **Key-Value Pairs**: Large hash symbols emphasize lookup mechanism
- **Distributed Access**: Corner nodes show multiple access points
- **Data Flow**: Arrows indicate active caching operations
- **DANDI Branding**: Brain logo identifies this as DANDI infrastructure
- **Data Entries**: Small rectangles show cached content

## Design Rationale

1. **Cache-First**: Database cylinders dominate the design making caching immediately obvious
2. **Text-Free**: Universal symbol transcending language barriers
3. **Industry Icons**: Database cylinders and hash symbols are universally recognized
4. **DANDI Branded**: Brain icon maintains connection to DANDI Archive
5. **Balanced Integration**: DANDI element present but doesn't overwhelm cache focus
6. **Multi-Layer**: Stacked design represents cache hierarchy/tiers
7. **Clear Function**: Every element relates to caching (storage, keys, access, data)
8. **Professional**: Clean, technical aesthetic for developer infrastructure
